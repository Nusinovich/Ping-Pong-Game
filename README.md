# Let's Play some PingPong

Welcome to my first PingPong game.
In this project, you will find my first solo project where you can go back in time and play the best. 
PingPong game, just you and the AI for hours.
As a kid, I loved to play the PingPong game with my little brother on the old Microsoft Windows 98, and I hope you will find
my 2023 version is fun.

# Game Description

In this PingPong game, you will play against AI, and your goal is to win all 5 levels and by doing that, you will be the champion.
Below, you will be able to find the rules in more detail:

1. The arrow keys on your keyboard will be used to control the paddle on the left.
2. The player who fails to hit the ball back loses the point.
3. The game is played until one player reaches 5 points.
4. The game difficulty will increase with each level you reach.
5. To be champion, you will need to win all 5 levels.
6. Remember to have fun!!!
